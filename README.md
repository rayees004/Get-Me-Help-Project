 **  'Traveling long distances in personal vehicles offers flexibility and convenience but also comes 
with challenges such as vehicle maintenance, breakdowns, and access to essential services. This 
project aims to develop a comprehensive Vehicle Assistance Service System named “Get Me 
Help” to support travelers by providing real-time vehicle diagnostics, roadside assistance, fuel 
station locators, and emergency services. Additionally, it will feature a mobile application that 
connects users with nearby service stations, mechanics, and towing services.'**
